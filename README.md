# RunAway-Luma-AI
To create videos using tools like Luma or Runway, here's a Python-based approach to automating parts of the video production pipeline. These tools provide powerful AI-based features, but you’ll still need some scripting to set up the flow.

Here’s a sample Python script that could be used to automate video editing tasks like scene transitions, object removal, or stylization (for instance, in RunwayML or Luma). This can be useful when integrating raw footage into a final product.

    Setup: Install necessary packages, such as runway-python for integration with RunwayML, or use moviepy for general video manipulation.
    Preprocessing: The footage needs to be prepared for AI-based transformations.
    Video Editing: Using Runway or Luma API to apply models (like style transfer, object removal, etc.) to the footage.

Sample Python Code for Video Editing with moviepy and AI APIs

import moviepy.editor as mp
import requests
import json

# Function to load video and create basic transitions with moviepy
def create_transition_video(input_video_path, output_video_path):
    clip = mp.VideoFileClip(input_video_path)

    # Example of trimming or splitting clips for transitions
    start_time = 10  # start at 10s
    end_time = 20    # end at 20s
    trimmed_clip = clip.subclip(start_time, end_time)

    # Apply a fade-in and fade-out transition
    final_clip = trimmed_clip.fadein(2).fadeout(2)

    # Write the final video
    final_clip.write_videofile(output_video_path, codec='libx264')

# Example API request to RunwayML for style transfer or other AI models
def apply_runway_model(input_video_path, output_video_path, model="style_transfer"):
    # Replace with your actual API key and Runway model endpoint
    api_url = "https://api.runwayml.com/v1/model/{model}/predict"
    headers = {
        "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_RUNWAY_API_KEY",
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
    }
    
    data = {
        "input": input_video_path,  # Path to your video file or video URL
        "output": output_video_path,
        "parameters": {
            "style": "van_gogh"  # Example: use a specific style for style transfer
        }
    }

    response = requests.post(api_url.format(model=model), headers=headers, json=data)
    if response.status_code == 200:
        print("Video processed successfully!")
    else:
        print(f"Error: {response.status_code}, {response.text}")

# Example usage
input_video = "path_to_your_video.mp4"
output_video = "output_video.mp4"

# Create basic transitions
create_transition_video(input_video, output_video)

# Apply AI-based model via Runway
apply_runway_model(input_video, output_video)

Key Components:

    MoviePy: This Python library is useful for editing video files—like cutting, transitions, effects, or adding audio. It integrates seamlessly with other tools for simple edits.
    RunwayML API: The apply_runway_model function demonstrates how to call an API (RunwayML) for tasks like style transfer, object recognition, or background manipulation.
    Handling Input and Output: The script loads raw footage and applies AI-based transformations (style transfer, object removal, etc.) before saving it.

Notes:

    This script assumes a basic understanding of video processing and API integrations.
    The specific tools (like Luma or Runway) would require access credentials and specific model configurations.
    You can automate batch processing for multiple video files or create more complex editing pipelines.

This script can help streamline video production by automating tedious steps and focusing more on creative tasks.
